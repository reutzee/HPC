For this assignment,
Our Heuristics function , for each NODE in the Search Tree (which represents a state), returns the number of People WE CANNOT SAVE.
the calculation:
for the state of the node, we calculate the shortest (in time) path to a POPULATED house, and from there, to the nearest
Shelter.
if we don't make it, we add the population of that house to our return value.

this is done for each house. so eventually we get the number of people who would (unfortunately) die.

this heuristic is making our problem a "minimization" problem. so choosing "where to go" in the world is based
on a simple decision - where would we "kill" less people. our shortest path algorithm gives us a lower bound for that.

calculating the number of people we WOULD SAVE is not that straight forward. because we cannot be sure
how many people we would ABSOLUTELY save (differs for each agent). so we cannot guarantee any bound for that number.


How to run the assignment  ?
-----------------------------
run sim.py with the following flags:
-g <graph_file_path>   -   default is 'graph.txt'
-a <agent_file_path>   -   default s agents.txt   - this is for task 1 - running a few "simple" agents
-t <task number>       -   default is 1.          - task 2 is the smart agents, task 3 is the Vandal Bonus.
-s <smart_strategy>    -   default is GREEDY      - options are GREEDY, A*, RTA
-e <expand_limit>      -   default is 11          ** ONLY WORKS FOR RTA
-f <f_parameter>       -   default is -100        - should be -1 or -100 or -10000. for the performance measurement
