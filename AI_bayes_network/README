The graph file is is given to the program as input (Example graph in graph.txt)
when running the program the user can:
    - Report floodings and Not-floodings
    - Report Blockages and Free-edges
    - Report Evacuees and Vertices empty from evacuees
    - query a set of edges being free of blockage
    - print reasoning required by the assignment specifications
    - run the bonus - for a given source and desttination vertex, print the "best" path (with highest probability of being free of blockages)
    - reset the reports.
